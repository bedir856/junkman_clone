# Data (Keep small sample, ignore large downloads if any)
# But here we want to keep the data for the user to verify
# So we won't ignore data/ for now, unless it's huge. 
# The zip is 200KB, it's fine.

# CoreML (We want to commit the model)
# But usually large files are ignored. model is 30KB. Keep it.
